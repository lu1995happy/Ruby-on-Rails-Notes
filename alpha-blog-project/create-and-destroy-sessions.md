# Create and Destroy Sessions

#### Fill in the create and destroy actions in the sessions\_controller.rb file with the following:

```ruby
def create
  user = User.find_by(email: params[:session][:email].downcase)
  if user && user.authenticate(params[:session][:password])
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    flash[:success] = "You have successfully logged in"
    redirect_to user_path(user)
  else
    flash.now[:danger] = "There was something wrong with your login information"
    render 'new'
  end
end

def destroy
  session[:user_id] = nil
  flash[:success] = "You have logged out"
  redirect_to root_path
end
```

#### Add a logout link to your navigation partial \(\_navigation.html.erb\) in the app/views/layouts folder by changing one of the default links which are listed as &lt;li&gt; item:

`<li><%= link_to 'Log out', logout_path, method: :delete %></li>`
